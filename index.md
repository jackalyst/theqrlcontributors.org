# Welcome to The QRL Contributors

Contribution is the backbone of any opensource project like The QRL, and is emergent from the community that surrounds it. It's important to keep things not only accessible and open, but also simple, enticing, guided, cohesive, and malleable to the changing needs of both the project and how it fits into the wider cryptocurrency and global space.

This is where *The QRL Contributors* comes into play.

## Primary Goals

1. **Accessible:** Where possible, the team and contributors should be reachable and act as ambassadors.
2. **Open:** Discussions and the general development of materials should be a public process that’s transparent.
3. **Progressive:** Moving forward with an open mind to the ever changing future technology while keeping a focus on security.

## Secondary Goals

1. **Enticing:** Creating an incentive scheme that is appealing, sustainable, and produces results.
2. **Guided:** Structure is important to establishing a common vision within which to work. Additionally so is outlining proper scope and tracking long-term tasks for coordinating people from each working group.
3. **Cohesive:** Everybody has their own skill-set(s) to contribute, and should be encouraged and endorsed for self-electing the way in which they’d like to participate. However, each working group should be formed with the innate ability and desirability to work cohesively with every other working group. This may be an important enough goal to have a group all on its own, as it presents special usability and tooling challenges.
4. **Malleable:** It’s important to remain flexible so that significant overhead is not incurred to make necessary changes.
5. **Resilient:** Permissions and tasks should be set up and documented in such a way that any working group or person can walk away from the project with no warning and not meaningfully negatively impact efforts.
