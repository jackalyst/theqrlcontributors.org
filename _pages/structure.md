# Overview

The QRL Contributors structure is comprised of one core value:

- Transparency: The efforts of The QRL Contributors is done publicly through the platforms [Trello](https://trello.com/theqrlcontributors), [Discord](https://discord.gg/uztY3Kj), and [GitHub](https://github.com/theqrl-community).

And two key organisational components:

- Roles: These can be seen as skillsets and are used to indicate an area of expertise a person has.
- Working Groups: Are committees of people to achieve a unified goal. Some of these, like advocacy, are more permanent, but others might be temporary in nature to cover one-time project, such as an event. They are comprised of people with multiple roles.

Roles and working groups are used much as possible through each of our platforms. This makes the overall system easier to follow once a person understands the various roles and working groups. For example, we have a channel, [#wg-advocacy](https://discord.gg/ZSSFhma), which corresponds to the trello board, [wg-advocacy](https://trello.com/b/xwpVCMHv/wg-advocacy).

# Roles

Roles allows contributors to signal, identify and call upon each others strengths and capabilities. A role can be self-assigned by any contributor for areas they feel comfortable working in, are interested in getting into, or otherwise have talent in.

For the workflow, a role can be flagged on a platform with @{ROLE}. For instance, if someone is working on a new website, there will be multiple roles that would be required to complete. For the backend, someone might need a **@developer**, where as for design elements they might need a **@designer**. The idea is to call on the strengths of each other.

- Designer
- Developer
- Writer
- Advocate
- Moderator

# Working Groups (WG's)

Contributors can choose to be part of one or more working groups (WG). 

These can be seen as committees of people with various skillsets which come together to achieve specified goals. Often a working group is similar to a skillset (ie. @wg-advocacy), but not always (ie. @wg-documentation, @wg-website).

- [#wg-advocacy](#advocacy)
- [#wg-brand](#brand)
- [#wg-community](#community)
- [#wg-digitalmedia](#digital-media)
- [#wg-documentation](#documentation)
- [#wg-education](#education)
- [#wg-massmedia](#mass-media)
- [#wg-website](#website)

It's possible to create working groups as need be to achieve a specified goal or set of goals.
