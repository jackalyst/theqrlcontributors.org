# Overview

The QRL Contributors structure is comprised of three main concepts.

- Open: The efforts of The QRL Contributors is done publicly through the platforms [Trello](https://trello.com/theqrlcontributors), [Discord](https://discord.gg/uztY3Kj), and [GitHub](https://github.com/theqrl-community). In each area, the general community has a capacity to participate, but is mostly only able to observe.
- Roles: These can be seen as skillsets and are used to indicate an area of expertise a person has.
- Working Groups: Are sub-projects of the QRL ecosystem. Some of these, like advocacy, are more permanent, but others might be temporary in nature to cover one-time project, such as an event. They are comprised of people with multiple roles.

Roles and working groups are used much as possible through each of our platforms. This makes the overall system easier to follow once a person understands the various roles and working groups. For example, we have a channel, [#wg-advocacy](https://discord.gg/ZSSFhma), which corresponds to the trello board, [wg-advocacy](https://trello.com/b/xwpVCMHv/wg-advocacy).

# Roles

Roles allow us to break users into sub-groups based on the users strengths and capabilities. A role is self assigned by the user for areas they feel comfortable working in, are interested in getting into, or otherwise have talent in.

For the workflow, a role can be flagged on a platform with @{ROLE}. For instance, if someone is working on a new website, there will be multiple roles that would be required to complete. For the backend, you might need a @developer, where as for design elements you'll need a @designer. The idea is to call on the strengths of each other.

- Designer
- Developer
- Writer
- Advocate
- Moderator

# Working Groups

Working groups are sub-projects to the QRL ecosystem. They are often comprised of people of many different roles working to achieve a unified goal.
