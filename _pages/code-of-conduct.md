## Guiding Principles

The QRL contributors and its surrounding communities are made up of those from all over the world working together to participate in positive, forward-thinking, good faith discussions. This is in-turn observed by a wide range of individuals including younger demographics. Disagreements among such a diverse community are bound to happen, and it's important that we try to understand why so that we can resolve differing views constructively - remember that we are different. All discussions should strive to be initiated and maintained in a considerate and respectful manner.

## Community code-of-conduct

### Do not spam, shill, or otherwise use this area to promote your, or someone else’s, product/platform. 

Open dialog, including about other projects, is allowed, but using the QRL community as an opportunity to solely promote/shill a platform, unless it's in exchange for QRL, won’t be tolerated. 

### Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment/harm towards anyone. 

It’s okay to disagree, but continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments may cross the line into harassment and will not be tolerated. Releasing people's personal information publicly (ie. doxing), is included in this, whether or not the person being doxed is a public figure.

Indirect or otherwise, it’s not okay to attack and threaten harm other to individuals for any reason. Death threats are subject to an immediate ban on all our platforms.

### Do not use vulgar language that’s not family friendly. 

This includes no profanity, bigotry, attacks, threats, vulgar or violent language, concealed or otherwise. If it’s not appropriate to say around young kids, it’s not going to be appropriate in our official QRL communities.

### Do not incite or encourage illegal or market manipulation activities. 

Promoting leaks, buying/selling drugs, tax evasion, pyramid schemes, or conspiring to perform a pump/dump, along with anything laid out in the community platforms Terms of Service (ToS) isn't permitted.

### Do not partake in deceptive activities or actions. 

Usernames which are deceptive (ie. coo, ceo, founder…), or advertising in nature (url’s, etc).

Referral links and the use of URL shortening services is a form of deceptive activity as it obfuscates the child url.
