## Step 1. Be part of the community

*Most* of what The QRL Contributors do is done in public forums and websites, which you can take part in *without* needing to be a full-fledged contributor and instead as a community member. 

The activities and behaviour demonstrated as a community member will influence whether you would be accepted as a QRL Contributor, so it's important to have a good grasp of our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

### Communities

1. **The QRL Contributors Discord.** A lot of the day-to-day discussions from The QRL Contributors are handled in our discord server. For community members, there's public channels that anyone can participate in. Join The QRL Contributors Discord [here](). 
2. **The QRL Community Discord.** This is where most of our community gathers which anyone is free to participate in. Our main discord server can be [found here](https://discord.gg/jBT6BEp).
2. **Trello.** For those unfamiliar with Trello, it's a web-based kanban-style list-making application which is geared towards more formally tracking todo items. While the community doesn't have *full* access, it's possible to get in and vote on the things you'd like to see the most. This helps guide priorities for the project. Our trello boards can be [found here](https://trello.com/theqrlcontributors/home) 

## Step 2. Request to become a contributor (or get invited)

So, you've been part of The QRL Community, watched The QRL Contributors in action and see a place you feel you can help contribute! This is great to hear! 

There's two ways to becoming a contributor:

1. **Get invited.** If we've seen you've had productive contributions in chat and have otherwise been part of the community you may get invited to be a contributor.

2. **Request to be invited.** Introduce yourself to one of the existing contributors through a private message! We'll then review your request privately and make our decision to accept your request or not. Don't feel too discouraged if your request isn't accepted and feel free to re-request again after some time has passed!

## 3. Once you're accepted
