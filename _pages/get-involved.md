## Becoming a contributor

So, you've been part of The QRL Community, watched The QRL Contributors in action and see a place you feel you can help contribute! This is great to hear! 

There's two ways to becoming a contributor:

1. **Get invited.** If we've seen you've had productive contributions in chat and have otherwise been part of the community you may get invited to be a contributor.

2. **Request to be invited.** Introduce yourself to one of the existing contributors through a private message! We'll then review your request privately and make our decision to accept your request or not. Don't feel too discouraged if your request isn't accepted and feel free to re-request again after some time has passed!

## Once you're accepted

You'll want to read the [onboarding](/onboarding/) document.
