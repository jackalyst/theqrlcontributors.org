## Becoming a contributor

So, you've been part of The QRL Community, watched The QRL Contributors in action and see a place you feel you can help contribute! Great.

There's two ways to becoming a contributor:

1. Get invited. If we've seen you've had productive contributions in chat and have otherwise been part of the community you may get invited to be a contributor.
2. Request to be invited. Follow the sticky in #contributors-introduction and introduce yourself while tagging one of the contributors. We'll then review your request privately and make our decision to accept your request or not. Don't feel too discouraged if your request isn't accepted and feel free to re-request in a months time!
